# hello-world
This is my first repository. I'm learning to use GitHub and intend to improve my coding experience with it as well as start collaborating on projects.

I'm an electrical engineering apprentice which will soon finish his apprenticeship (September 2022). I've learned a lot of stuff and explored multiple domains during my studies. I now know that I like programmation a LOT, I have some good experience in C programmation a bit on Python and I've got the bassis for object oriented programmation via C++ classes during my studies. Still my degree is about electrical engineering and I lack some knowledge about the development world. I intend in filling the gap and orient my carrer toward a developper role.
